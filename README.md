# Unity3D-Utility-Scripts
These are some C# scripts that I wrote for use in the Unity3D game engine.  
These scripts are ones that I find myself using across multiple projects, so I thought they may be useful for others to have.  
Credit for some of the scripts goes to some tutorials I found online (e.g. catlikecoding).

Packages:
- save_io.unitypackage:  Includes SaveIO.cs, which has methods to save various datatypes in a binary format.
